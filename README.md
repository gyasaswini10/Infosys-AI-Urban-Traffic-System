https://github.com/gyasaswini10/Infosys-AI-Urban-Traffic-System.git
Project Statement
NeuroFleetX is a next-generation AI-driven platform designed to optimize urban mobility and fleet operations for rental, transport, and smart city use cases using AI, IoT, and geospatial data.
1. Introduction
The NeuroFleetX project is a comprehensive AI-enabled fleet management and urban mobility optimization system built to streamline logistics, improve routing, and enhance overall transportation efficiency. The system leverages artificial intelligence, real-time data processing, and modern web technologies to support smart decision-making in urban mobility environments.
With the rapid growth of urban populations and increasing vehicle usage, traffic congestion and inefficient fleet utilization have become major challenges for smart cities and transport services. NeuroFleetX addresses these issues by integrating intelligent route optimization, traffic monitoring, predictive analytics, and real-time vehicle tracking into a unified platform.
